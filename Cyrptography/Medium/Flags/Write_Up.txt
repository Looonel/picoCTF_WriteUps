At first, with no hints whatsoever other than the fact that it starts with PICOCTF, I thought these were augmented country flags. This is
beacause some of the flags look like country flags that seem slightly off, such as France, Spain, Japan, Costa Rica, Scotland, etc. But
when I was trying to find what these flags mean, I stumble across a Facebook post that shows the same flags along with the translation for each flag. 
Through clicking that picture in Google, it opened up more flag translations and soon enough I found out that these were actually "International Maritime Flags". 
These are used by people to communicate to ships out on the sea internationally. Things like "Alpha", "Beta", "Charlie", "India", etc. 
Through a complete table of all the flags I found in Google (which I uploaded in the same folder as this file), I was able to retrieve the flag, which is: 

PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
