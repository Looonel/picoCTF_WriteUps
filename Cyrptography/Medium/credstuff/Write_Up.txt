The challenge starts off with explaining that there is a leak from the blackmarket website's login credentials. The challenge tells us to find the password to
the user named 'cultiris' and that the file containing the leaked usernames and passwords are parallel to each other. This means that the user in the first line
of the leaked usernames file will have the password of the first line of the leaked passwords file and so on.

Upon downloading the given file, you'll have a .tar file named "leak.tar". We have to unzip it to know its contents. I did this by using the "tar xvf" command.

After unzipping it, inside the folder will be two .txt files named "usernames.txt" and "passwords.txt". My first instinct was to print both of the files contents.
Turns out both files have a large amount of lines that I do not know the range of. But at the very start of the challenge, it did tell us the username that we need
to find, that is "cultiris". Knowing this, I used the "egrep" command to find if there is such username along with the line which the username is in within the
file. 

egrep -n cultiris usernames.txt
  
Sure enough, it worked. Now I know that the username "cultiris" does exist in the leaked usernames file and its on line 378. However, it would be such a hassle
for me to search the passwords.txt file until line 378. To counter this, I used the "cat head tail" command to find the 378th line from the passwords.txt file.

cat passwords.txt |head -378|tail -1 This works because it's telling the computer to print out the last line from the first 378 lines.

Through this, I finally got the flag: cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}

After looking at it closely, I can tell that this is a caesar cipher with 8 shifts to the right of the original letter. Putting this into a caesar cipher decrypter
will result in the flag: picoCTF{C7r1F_54V35_71M3}
